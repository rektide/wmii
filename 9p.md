# Tips About 9p Capabilities  #

This page covers how to mount the wmii file system on Linux or [http://doc.cat-v.org/inferno/ Inferno], see [http://9p.cat-v.org/ 9P] for a list of [http://9p.cat-v.org/implementations other 9P client libraries in various languages].

Also you should consider using [sqweeks 9mount helper tools](http://sqweek.net/code/9mount/).

## 9p.ko ##

2.6.14 ? 2.6.16

```
modprobe 9p2000
mount -t 9p $WMII_NS_DIR/wmii /mnt/wmii -o proto=unix,name=$USER,noextend
```

2.6.17 ? 2.6.23

```
modprobe 9p
mount -t 9P $WMII_NS_DIR/wmii /mnt/wmii -o proto=unix,name=$USER,noextend
```

2.6.24 ? current

```
modprobe 9pnet
modprobe 9p
mount -t 9p $WMII_NS_DIR/wmii /mnt/wmii -o trans=unix,uname=$USER,noextend,dfltgid=$(id -g),dfltuid=$(id -u)
```

Afterwards the filesystem of wmii is exported to /mnt/wmii. Note that you can simplify the process using 9mount, with which the mount command becomes:

```
9mount -i 'unix!'$WMII_NS_DIR/wmii /mnt/wmii
```

## Inferno ##

If you have installed inferno, you can mount the wmii filesystem if you edit the wmii script through setting a tcp-socket capable address:

```
export WMII_ADDRESS=tcp!localhost!5555
instead of the default unix-socket file based address.
```

From within inferno you can then mount the filesystem easily:

```
mount -A tcp!localhost!5555 /mnt/wmii
```

Or with unix domain sockets, you can mount them in inferno through any of a number of ugly hacks. The following requires plan9port, and will work regardless of the value of your $WMII_ADDRESS:

```
mount -A {os rc -c 'exec dial $WMII_ADDRESS' >[1=0]} /mnt/wmii
```

or netcat:

```
mount -A {os sh -c 'nc -U /tmp/ns.$USER.$DISPLAY/wmii' >[1=0]} /mnt/wmii
```

I suspect that the overhead of piping through dial or netcat is comparable to the overhead of TCP.

Have fun ;)
