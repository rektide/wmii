== sunaku's Ruby wmiirc ==

[http://github.com/sunaku/wmiirc/tree/master sunaku's Ruby wmiirc] manipulates wmii (in the Ruby way) through the [http://snk.tuxfamily.org/lib/rumai/ Rumai] library which speaks directly to wmii via the 9P2000 protocol and features an [http://snk.tuxfamily.org/lib/rumai/#Tutorial interactive Ruby shell for live entertainment].

This wmiirc features:

  *Logging and crash recovery.
  *DSL for events, keystrokes, and actions in wmii.
  *Manipulating multiple clients simultaneously.
  *Automatic client arrangement (LarsWM, grid, diamond, etc.)
  *Zooming clients to a temporary workspace.
  *Closing all clients before exiting wmii.
  *[http://mpd.wikia.com/ Music Player Daemon (MPD)] integration.
  *Shortcuts optimized for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard Dvorak layout] on a [http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/advantage.htm Kinesis keyboard].
  *And [http://snk.tuxfamily.org/log/wmii-3.1-ruby-config.html so much more]?

All of this can be configured to suit your needs, of course.
