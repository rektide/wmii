wmii was designed to be scriptable in any language you choose. Here are some alternative wmiirc scripts, in various languages. Feel free to add your own, with a short description of its features and its language.

== sunaku's Ruby wmiirc ==

sunaku's Ruby wmiirc manipulates wmii (in the Ruby way) through the Rumai library which speaks directly to wmii via the 9P2000 protocol and features an interactive Ruby shell for live entertainment.

This wmiirc features:

  *Logging and crash recovery.
  *DSL for events, keystrokes, and actions in wmii.
  *Manipulating multiple clients simultaneously.
  *Automatic client arrangement (LarsWM, grid, diamond, etc.)
  *Zooming clients to a temporary workspace.
  *Closing all clients before exiting wmii.
  *Music Player Daemon (MPD) integration.
  *Shortcuts optimized for Dvorak layout on a Kinesis keyboard.
  *And so much more?
  *All of this can be configured to suit your needs, of course.
